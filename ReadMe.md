
# AAPIStub

This set of Python scripts will generate Live API documentation in JSON format, based on realtime inspection of the Live module.

To run, first drop the AAPIStub folder into Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory: `/Applications/Ableton Live 11 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/`

Next, select "AAPIStub" from the MIDI Preferences dialog, then reset immediately to "None" (there is no need to close the dialog first). `Live.json` will be written to the user home directory.
